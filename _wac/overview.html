Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. Another one. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. We don’t see them, we will never see them. Surround yourself with angels. Surround yourself with angels. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! How’s business? Boomin.

I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. Stay focused. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. Hammock talk come soon. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail.
