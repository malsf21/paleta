  <p class="lead">
    Welcome to the style guide for the World Affairs Conference! On our Paleta site, you'll find information to help you understand our design style: one that's based on simplicity and minimalism, even though both of those are heavily used graphic-design buzzwords.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    In this style guide, you'll find quite a few things: a set of pages that explain how our design style works, files and examples for our design styling, and some occasional tips and tricks regarding how to make cool stuff for or about WAC. This style guide will be the most useful to our developers and designers, though all are welcome to use this as a resource. While we hope most of this is self-explanatory, please let us know (for now, that's just <a href="https://matthewwang.me">Matthew Wang</a>), and we'll do our best to make sure this all makes sense.

  <p class="lead">
    There is no <b>correct</b> design setup, and this section isn't going to tell you what the "correct" style is. Rather, we're just going to outline what we recommend for design. Also, as a side note: our software assumes that you're using a Mac, since all of WAC is run on them. If you don't have a Mac, there are Windows versions or alternatives to all of these programs.

      All of the software works with WAC right out of the box; the only post-download setup step that's required is installing Nik's Photoshop plugin. Once you have that done, you're ready to start designing with WAC!
